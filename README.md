===============
The Class Scheduler application is a simple web application that is used to resolve conflicts while selecting courses in Universities. This Project was done Specifically for University of Texas at Dallas as a part of Object Oriented Analysis and Design coursework.

The basic functionality of the application is to allow users resolve conflicts before selecting courses. The application flow is as follows:

- User Login
- Course Selection
- Course Conflicts Detection and Display
- Allow the Users to Register for Courses

Object Oriented Analysis and Design Principles:
-----------------------------------------------
The web application makes good use of some of the well known OOAD principles. The application follows a Model View Controller(MVC) architecture separating each layer. The various layers we have used in our application:
-View
-Model
-Action(Controller)
-Dao(Data Access Object)

In addition to these we have also used some of the GRASP and GoF(Gand of Four) patterns while developing the application. We have used Agile Methodology as our Object Oriented Methodology and Scrum to manage the project.

Version Control:
----------------
For version control we have used Git which worked just awesome for us. We believe that a good version control system is key in managing a project's source code.
